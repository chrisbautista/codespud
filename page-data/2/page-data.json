I’ve always wanted to make this webapp that has been playing in my mind  for a while and I finally had some ideas to start on.  Of course, like any of my projects, the first thing I do is research. First in my list was a workflow to streamline development. It’s been a while since I modified my workflow and so I thought it was time for a change.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Aside from the design and flow of the application, my immediate concern was where to host my apps once I’m done with the first milestone. I was researching around the interweb and a familiar link caught my eye.  Heroku was the 2nd link of my search. I investigated Heroku when I first made a Facebook application for Lowe Philippines.  I remember seeing a link to Heroku from Facebook’s “Create App” wizard. Back then I was more curious than impressed. Anyway, this time I was very curious but now I’m also very impressed with how Heroku made it easy to deploy an app. Heroku does not magically build a scaffold for you but it does guide you through steps in their “Getting started” page and heck it’s free.  </p>\n<p><strong>What you get for a free account?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One(1) Dyno</li>\n<li>10,000 rows of data (postgres)</li>\n<li>512 Mb RAM</li>\n<li>One(1) hour business-hour support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A dyno is a processing unit coined by Heroku. Heroku help says “A dyno is a lightweight container running a single user-specified command. You can think of it as a virtualized Unix container—it can run any command available in its default environment”. It’s a lot to take in but it simply means you have one worker processing requests and things for you to serve your website and other arbitrary functions like data requests.  One seems not a lot but with how fast this requests gets done you won’t even notice, unless of course your application gets some substantial traffic.  Aside from the dyno, you get to save 10000 rows of data to Postgres and a generous 512Mb RAM allocation.  If you think your application will need more resources, you can scale up by buying more dynos.  But for a hobby app or POC, a Heroku free account will serve you nicely.</p>\n<p><strong>How to start?</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku is very easy to setup.  You can go straight to the toolbelt and the dashboard or you can go to their Getting Started page, which I recommend if you’re starting to learn or new to deploying to Heroku.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/start\" title=\"start here to build your heroku app\">Getting Started</a> &#x3C;-  start here</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku supports a number of languages including PHP, NodeJS etc.  This time I was making a PHP application with some AngularJS for the frontend so I followed the PHP track. Anyway, I just did the steps and I got a functional workflow as a starting point.</p>\n<p>In summary the steps are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and Install Heroku Toolbelt for your OS.</li>\n<li>Login to Heroku</li>\n<li>Get keys</li>\n<li>Create App</li>\n<li>Deploy App with git push</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Is that it?</strong></p>\n<p>You followed the steps, and you got a lean file structure to start with. You have to ,of course, be familiar with Composer and Git to optimize your project, both of which are not covered by this post. Just google them, there are a lot of well written articles and tutorials out there. I especially like the ff:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md\">https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics\">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics</a></p>\n<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>The cool thing about this is everything is accessible and manageable from one console. If you’re a little queasy at the idea of working with the console,  this might not be the best thing for you. An alternative is the Heroku dashboard – just create the app and  setup a more familiar way of deployment like github.  Just provide Heroku of a repo and Heroku will monitor and automatically deploy your app when a change is uploaded.</p>\n<p>Heroku is neat and well documented. There’s a bit of a learning curve  especially if you’re starting to learn to code or is a total console-phobe. Also, if you’re app has grown popular and pulling some substantial traffic, you need to increase the dynos or your app will shutdown and refuse to process requests. Which will catch a hefty bill. Nevertheless, it does get you started with some impressive workflow and and it’s free-ish. 🙂</p>\n<p><em>Some notes:</em></p>\n<p>First time you push a project (git push heroku master) and it’s empty, it would trigger a error similar to this</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">!     Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected</code></p>\n<p>It just means, Heroku does not know what your app is about and so it can’t build the application. Solution is just provide a common starter file like index.php or index.html. This will tell Heroku that you have a PHP or HTML project and build the necessary dependencies.  You can also fix this by providing a composer.json, setting up the dependencies you need.</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-318 size-full\" src=\"/assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-768x449.png\" alt=\"Deploy\" width=\"846\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"/assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM.png 846w, /assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-300x176.png 300w, /assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-768x449.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px\" />","fields":{"slug":"/2014/quick-and-free-way-to-set-up-your-app-using-heroku/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 20, 2014","title":"Quick and Free Way to Set Up Your App using Heroku","featured_image":"/assets/2014/08/features-tools-3dc022115028973bfa824eb354f1d87c.png","tags":["website","devops"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"When I started blogging again last September, I was delighted to get a template with built-in message polling to twitter.

I am not a prolific ‘twitterer’, but I love the whole concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropublishing\">micropublishing</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Sometimes when I feel lazy but I want something new in potatokorner; I’d post a tweet, from quotes to funny videos, just to see the widget change(LOL). Great as it is – it’s not perfect. What the widget lacks is interactivity. One day, I started planning (with frameworks like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">Jquery</a> and <a href=\"http://mootools.net/\">Mootools</a> in mind), to make a custom widget that can access <a href=\"http://apiwiki.twitter.com/\">twitter API</a> with features like searching for a user’s tweets or scrolling through a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twitter101/learning\">Trending Topic</a> . Also thought adding some nice animation and CSS styles. Luckily, I don’t have to; the nice peeps from Twitter beat me to the punch and released a widget – packing almost all the things I wanted. I experimented with this along with some feed scripts from Google a days back (<a href=\"http://potatokorner.blogspot.com/2009/10/updates-on-pepeng.html#main\">Updates on Pepeng</a>).</p>\n<h4>What is a Twitter Search Widget!?</h4>\n<p>The widget’s concept is to supply the it with a search term (or phrase), like ‘potatokorner’ and it will periodically check twitter.com for tweets with the word potatokorner – but not just tweets by yours truly – every single tweet which it appears. Unlike a regular search the widget periodically pulls messages from the site(twitter) and displays it in a marquee. Twitter.com describes it,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Displays search results in real time! Ideal for live events, broadcastings, conferences, TV Shows, or even just keeping up with the news.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Get the widget</h4>\n<p>Making your widget is easy. Log in to twitter.com. Open the Settings page, then click <a href=\"http://twitter.com/goodies/widgets\">“You can add twitter to your site here”</a>.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/Stvr3MiCQ0I/AAAAAAAADK0/PAJxPF4FpjA/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget.PNG\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/Stvr3MiCQ0I/AAAAAAAADK0/PAJxPF4FpjA/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>You are asked where you want to place your widget, click “My Website”.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvssWMQRVI/AAAAAAAADLE/0h7qv6ggYV4/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget-step2.PNG\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvssWMQRVI/AAAAAAAADLE/0h7qv6ggYV4/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget-step2.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Then, you are presented three widgets, choose the “Search Widget”.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvsyHJVE6I/AAAAAAAADLM/tFwZeVyrcxI/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget-step3.PNG\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvsyHJVE6I/AAAAAAAADLM/tFwZeVyrcxI/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-widget-step3.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Now what you have before you is the heart of the “search widget” configuration.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtGGtbBOI/AAAAAAAADLU/aaM8noAbmZU/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-config.PNG\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtGGtbBOI/AAAAAAAADLU/aaM8noAbmZU/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-config.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>You’ll learn when you’ve finally playing with your new widget that it’s a parsing nightmare when people add tags even if their topics are not related, especially when it’s a “trending topic”. Fortunately, Twitter.com provided quite a collection of filters to narrow down your search. You can limit tweets to a certain vicinity( near:{location}) or screen out certain words ( -{word}), you can even limit them to happy ones ( 🙂 ). See <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/operators\">Advance operators</a> to build your strings. I won’t touch this much, but I’ll explain what I’m going to use.</p>\n<p>For our example, I want to add a twitter search widget to find tweets with the word “party”, but I only want positive or happy tweets! , thus the smiley, ” 🙂 “. The smiley is a generic one, but twitter is smart enough to find all the variations (e.g. “:D”,”=)” etc. ). Now lets test it.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtQSnAXbI/AAAAAAAADLc/OW3As3VfJpY/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-test.PNG\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtQSnAXbI/AAAAAAAADLc/OW3As3VfJpY/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-test.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Great!

Though I recommend using <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">“Dev”</a>, for plugin support and cutting edge stuff. Secondly a list of online services that emulates software you normally would install like Gmail/YahooMail(Email), Grooveshark(Music Player) etc. Also, depending on the web application, you might need to register for accounts to use their services.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>The secret of this system is Chrome’s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95710\" target=\"_blank\">create application shortcuts</a>. It’s a menu item inside the page menu, shown below.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9Kkvps7I/AAAAAAAADJ8/bms9XUcHG5I/s1600-h/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step1.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9Kkvps7I/AAAAAAAADJ8/bms9XUcHG5I/s400/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step1.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Why use this you say, when you can simply bookmark the sites URL. Firstly, making webapps as application shortcuts makes them readily accessible; without the extra steps of opening a browser and finding the bookmark. Also, to get the illusion of a desktop app, we need the chrome(extra browser sections like the menu bar, status bar etc) to disappear(See below) leaving only the application in its intended glory.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StJoSaWGMfI/AAAAAAAADKc/GqIOV1K0_64/s1600-h/potatokorner-chromeless-window.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StJoSaWGMfI/AAAAAAAADKc/GqIOV1K0_64/s400/potatokorner-chromeless-window.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>What is more awesome is whatever favicon image the site has, is saved with the shortcut as an icon.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StLytRz5lOI/AAAAAAAADKk/F4DfqmZNzPk/s1600-h/potatokorner-shortcuticons.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StLytRz5lOI/AAAAAAAADKk/F4DfqmZNzPk/s400/potatokorner-shortcuticons.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p><em>Note: This system can work for other browsers. I just used Chrome since most of what I need are Google Apps. So if you know how to do this in Firefox or IE then go ahead.</em><br>\nLet’s get started. Say we need an email client. You have either a choice between a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmail\" target=\"_blank\">webmail client</a>, like Gmail and Yahoo Mail, or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">POP</a>/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP\" target=\"_blank\">IMAP</a> client like Squirrel or Horde installation. Let’s go with Gmail. You log in to Gmail – find a comfortable page like the inbox or the login page. Normally for security purposes I’d go with the login page, but since I’m the only one using this workstation lets make it easy for me and pick the Inbox as our starting page.</p>\n<p>Now a popup should appear asking where you want to place your shortcut. It can be on the Desktop, the start menu, or a shortcut on the Quicklaunch bar. This is just a matter of preference. I prefer the Quicklaunch bar to maintain the minimalist feel of this system.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s1600-h/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s400/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"289\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Voila! you now have an email client on steroids. Well, almost. You can configure Gmail some more to personalize it. I’ll cover this part in a future post. Repeat this for other applications, each time finding the “comfortable” starting page when you create the shortcuts.

Any Operating System has it in some form or another(Anyone said <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))\" target=\"_blank\">Lynx</a>(?). Companies battle it out for supremacy, sometimes even forcing their religion; <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729&pn=2\" target=\"_blank\">I mean browser, down our throats</a>. Whatever a browser is or where it came from, it paved the way for the information superhighway AKA The Internet. That is cause for celebration and dedicatory site, won’t you agree? </p>\n<p>WhatBrowser.org is kind of timely if you think <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729\" target=\"_blank\">Oct 13 will be birthday no. 15</a> of the commercial browser. Imagine software, a teener! No wonder some people still gets confused (LOL).</p>\n<h2>Visit the site</h2>\n<p>When you visit the site, you are presented a video. The video is a cute presentation of what a browser Is and what it is Not. It continues with what you can do with it(browser). Watch the video. It may amuse you and educate you a bit at the same time. Also opposite the video is the name of the browser you used to access the site, the user-agent. You can see that I use Chrome. I will admit that lacking plugins for Chrome was kind of a turn off at first, but with the release of the <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">dev channel</a> and it’s plugin support, I found myself doing more and more work with it, but thats a topic for another day. </p>\n<p>Your user-agent may not be what you expect it to be,since some browsers enable you to <a href=\"http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html\" target=\"_blank\">change user agents</a>. The site also has 3 more sections below the video, linking to other features/services. I especially like the “Under the hood” page. There you can subject your browser to some benchmarking tests. I’ll post a comprehensive post related to this tests later.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s1600-h/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s400/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\"></a><br>WhatBrowser.Org\n</div>\n<p>The site is a awesome idea.

Each of which is inspired by different submissions. So no one submission can claim the idea, just part of the whole. Its a wonder how some minds are alike. 🙂 Even greater wonder that they choose to do good with those creative brains.<br>\n<a name=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>What now?!</strong></p>\n<p>Now they are asking for people to vote. To pick the ideas they believe can make the difference. Out of 16 they need 5 ideas to turn into funded projects. The call to vote started September 24, 2009 and will end October 8, 2009.

Read all the ideas, and look into yourself what you think will help this hurting world of ours. Then pick the best one. After that invite others( friends,family, co-workers etc.) to do the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>It’s great that large companies like Google still have that sense of civic responsibility to better this world.

As it seems, face recognition is activated from start , no warning whatsoever, but you do need to login to your picasa account to get your name tags.</p>\n<p>Processing seems a bit longer than usual, as with the old version, you can still use the application even while it’s still sorting through all your stuff – so no worries. Picasa 3.5 got almost 100% from my tests. I already tagged faces on Web Albums so I didn’t had the chance to tag new faces. But I’m amazed how good this works even if the person is facing front or showing their profile. Nevertheless, your results may vary depending on how distinct people in your photos are.
