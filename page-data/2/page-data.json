This has become more true with the surge of desktop applications to their web equivalents (email, desktop publishing, spreadsheet etc.) and the advancement in web technologies(AJAX, HTML5 etc). More and more I find myself using online versions of my computer’s desktop. <!--more-->Having been hosted on a remote server I enjoy; savings in storage space, automatic backups, safety from physical hardware damage(like for some of my friends affected by Typhoon Ondoy) and ready support(depends on the service provider). Though you do need to constantly have a decent internet connection, for me it works just fine. If you’re interested, read on!.</p>\n<h3>What you need?</h3>\n<p>You need to install <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Chrome</a> browser. No specific channel. Though I recommend using <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">“Dev”</a>, for plugin support and cutting edge stuff. Secondly a list of online services that emulates software you normally would install like Gmail/YahooMail(Email), Grooveshark(Music Player) etc. Also, depending on the web application, you might need to register for accounts to use their services.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>The secret of this system is Chrome’s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95710\" target=\"_blank\">create application shortcuts</a>. It’s a menu item inside the page menu, shown below.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9Kkvps7I/AAAAAAAADJ8/bms9XUcHG5I/s1600-h/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step1.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9Kkvps7I/AAAAAAAADJ8/bms9XUcHG5I/s400/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step1.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Why use this you say, when you can simply bookmark the sites URL. Firstly, making webapps as application shortcuts makes them readily accessible; without the extra steps of opening a browser and finding the bookmark. Also, to get the illusion of a desktop app, we need the chrome(extra browser sections like the menu bar, status bar etc) to disappear(See below) leaving only the application in its intended glory.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StJoSaWGMfI/AAAAAAAADKc/GqIOV1K0_64/s1600-h/potatokorner-chromeless-window.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StJoSaWGMfI/AAAAAAAADKc/GqIOV1K0_64/s400/potatokorner-chromeless-window.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>What is more awesome is whatever favicon image the site has, is saved with the shortcut as an icon.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StLytRz5lOI/AAAAAAAADKk/F4DfqmZNzPk/s1600-h/potatokorner-shortcuticons.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StLytRz5lOI/AAAAAAAADKk/F4DfqmZNzPk/s400/potatokorner-shortcuticons.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p><em>Note: This system can work for other browsers. I just used Chrome since most of what I need are Google Apps. So if you know how to do this in Firefox or IE then go ahead.</em><br>\nLet’s get started. Say we need an email client. You have either a choice between a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmail\" target=\"_blank\">webmail client</a>, like Gmail and Yahoo Mail, or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">POP</a>/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP\" target=\"_blank\">IMAP</a> client like Squirrel or Horde installation. Let’s go with Gmail. You log in to Gmail – find a comfortable page like the inbox or the login page. Normally for security purposes I’d go with the login page, but since I’m the only one using this workstation lets make it easy for me and pick the Inbox as our starting page.</p>\n<p>Now a popup should appear asking where you want to place your shortcut. It can be on the Desktop, the start menu, or a shortcut on the Quicklaunch bar. This is just a matter of preference. I prefer the Quicklaunch bar to maintain the minimalist feel of this system.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s1600-h/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s400/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"289\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Voila! you now have an email client on steroids. Well, almost. You can configure Gmail some more to personalize it. I’ll cover this part in a future post. Repeat this for other applications, each time finding the “comfortable” starting page when you create the shortcuts.

Any Operating System has it in some form or another(Anyone said <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))\" target=\"_blank\">Lynx</a>(?). Companies battle it out for supremacy, sometimes even forcing their religion; <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729&pn=2\" target=\"_blank\">I mean browser, down our throats</a>. Whatever a browser is or where it came from, it paved the way for the information superhighway AKA The Internet. That is cause for celebration and dedicatory site, won’t you agree? </p>\n<p>WhatBrowser.org is kind of timely if you think <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729\" target=\"_blank\">Oct 13 will be birthday no. 15</a> of the commercial browser. Imagine software, a teener! No wonder some people still gets confused (LOL).</p>\n<h2>Visit the site</h2>\n<p>When you visit the site, you are presented a video. The video is a cute presentation of what a browser Is and what it is Not. It continues with what you can do with it(browser). Watch the video. It may amuse you and educate you a bit at the same time. Also opposite the video is the name of the browser you used to access the site, the user-agent. You can see that I use Chrome. I will admit that lacking plugins for Chrome was kind of a turn off at first, but with the release of the <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">dev channel</a> and it’s plugin support, I found myself doing more and more work with it, but thats a topic for another day. </p>\n<p>Your user-agent may not be what you expect it to be,since some browsers enable you to <a href=\"http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html\" target=\"_blank\">change user agents</a>. The site also has 3 more sections below the video, linking to other features/services. I especially like the “Under the hood” page. There you can subject your browser to some benchmarking tests. I’ll post a comprehensive post related to this tests later.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s1600-h/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s400/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\"></a><br>WhatBrowser.Org\n</div>\n<p>The site is a awesome idea.

Each of which is inspired by different submissions. So no one submission can claim the idea, just part of the whole. Its a wonder how some minds are alike. 🙂 Even greater wonder that they choose to do good with those creative brains.<br>\n<a name=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>What now?!</strong></p>\n<p>Now they are asking for people to vote. To pick the ideas they believe can make the difference. Out of 16 they need 5 ideas to turn into funded projects. The call to vote started September 24, 2009 and will end October 8, 2009.

As it seems, face recognition is activated from start , no warning whatsoever, but you do need to login to your picasa account to get your name tags.</p>\n<p>Processing seems a bit longer than usual, as with the old version, you can still use the application even while it’s still sorting through all your stuff – so no worries. Picasa 3.5 got almost 100% from my tests. I already tagged faces on Web Albums so I didn’t had the chance to tag new faces. But I’m amazed how good this works even if the person is facing front or showing their profile. Nevertheless, your results may vary depending on how distinct people in your photos are. If it’s anything like Picasa Web Albums, the engine should improve in time the more you use it.</p>\n<p>Its a great addition to Picasa. It eases the pain of digging all your albums to find people.
