One of the accessibility challenges I have reworked for our company site is the tabbed container.</p>\n<p>Imagine a folder with pages you can flip through using tabs at the edges. That is the closest I can imagine when I think of tabbed containers. This concept is very straightforward, tabs on top of the container  serves as buttons to access the corresponding grouped content. Only one grouped content is shown at any time. I love tabbed containers because they are very good at cleaning up the interface when you have so much content but have the same level of importance.</p>\n<p>For the new component, I based it on the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/\">tab panel pattern</a> suggested in the WAI(<em>Web Accessibility Initiative</em>) site.</p>\n<h2>Focus Order</h2>\n<p>Using the keyboard with the old tabbed container, the focus goes from the first tab, 2nd tab, 3rd tab, and so on. Then the tab content 1, etc. One would need to finish traversing the tabs before you can access the first tab’s content. Its confusing to screenreader users as you would assume when you focus on the tab you can read the content.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/blog/build_an_accessible_tab_container___focus_order.png\" alt=\"incorrect focus order\">\n  <figcaption>\n    <p>The navigation sequence does not follow the natural way of content consumption.</p>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>To improve the focus/read order, we should make the first tab active and prevent the inactive tabs from getting the focus sequence. Navigation will go directly to the content when tabbing from the tab button. Another rule some UI developers forget is to make sure hidden elements do not get focus. So for the previous example, the “Services” and “Products” content panels and its content must not receive focus.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/blog/build_an_accessible_tab_container___correct_focus_order.png\" alt=\"corrected focus order\">\n  <figcaption>\n    <p> Now the user is only able to access the currently active tab and tab content</p>.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<!--ad-->\n<h2>Keyboard controls</h2>\n<p>The old tab container component only supported the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to navigate which only follows the DOM sequence. A few tabs are tolerable but once you get more than five(5) tabs it can be annoying for the user to use.</p>\n<p>To make the component keyboard accessible, we add behavior that follows the WAI tab panel pattern. The tab navigation activates once the focus goes to the active tab (button). Using the <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd> and <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd>, the user can navigate to the previous and next tabs correspondingly.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have two types of tab container behavior. <em>Automatic</em> tab containers will switch to a new tab when focus changes. While, <em>Manual</em> tabbed containers use <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> key to confirm the switch. I will use the “automatic” behavior for our demo.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/blog/build_an_accessible_tab_container___active_tab_focused.png\" alt=\"active tab is focused\">\n  <figcaption>\n    <p>The active tab shows focused styling when navigating with the keyboard. Using the arrow keys we can navigate to other tabs.</p>  \n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>ARIA attributes</h2>\n<figure>\n  <blockquote> Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <figcaption>\n    <cite>- MDN</cite>  \n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It would have been nice if there was a tab panel semantic tag. There is none so we use ARIA attributes. On their own ARIA attributes do not do much. It does not add styling or extra behavior. But for screen readers or tools that aid people with impairments, ARIA attributes paint a picture that a browser can interpret.</p>\n<p>For the tabbed container, we set the following ARIA attributes. </p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th style=\"min-width: 200px;\">ARIA attribute/role</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n  </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>role=tablist</td>\n    <td>Container for tab buttons</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>role=tab</td>\n    <td>Tab button element.

Luckily there’s a number of ways you can achieve this. <!--more--> </p>\n<h2>The Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Local editor/IDE via SFTP</strong>. - This entails connecting via SFTP and uploading the code changes manually. Problem with this setup, you need to run a lot of steps to test your code. Upload (manually) then run tests, rinse and repeat. Don’t expect to use any IDE functionality here. Not very useful but it works when the need arises. I recommend using <a href=\"https://winscp.net/eng/download.php\">WinSCP</a> on windows for this.  </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local editor/IDE with automatic syncing via an SFTP client.</strong> - Very similar to the first option minus the manual uploads. Some SFTP clients would have a “sync on changes” option. WinSCP has the  <a href=\"https://winscp.net/eng/docs/task_keep_up_to_date\">“keep up to date”</a> feature which serves this purpose well. </p>\n<p>For Apple machines, <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic’s</a> Coda/Transmit setup is a great example.  </p>\n<p>Additionally, using a plugin, some editors/IDE’s (e.g. SublimeText, VSCode, etc.) would be able to carry out the same use case. In my experience though, managing files via plugin is not very consistent. When it fails, it fails spectacularly with me ending up trying to resolve corrupted files. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!--ad-->\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local IDE using rsync</strong> - This setup leverages <a href=\"https://rsync.samba.org/features.html\">rsync</a> to synchronize your changes automatically. Using rsync is similar to using SFTP with automatic syncing. The difference is that rsync by default only upload/download files that changed. The most popular setup is to watch for file changes and then trigger a rsync command to upload only the delta. No manual uploading but not very different from the first one on this list. You can use inotifywait or gulps watch functionality to monitor file changes then manually trigger a function or command based on rsync.</p>\n<p><strong>Using inotifywait</strong>,</p>\n<div

local folders. Using this logic you can set up your remotely available codebase into your local IDE. This is very easy to put up since most Linux machines support SSH and it does not need any other libraries to install and configure. Although useful it’s not very consistently executed in most clients.\nFor windows, check out <a href=\"https://www.nsoftware.com/sftp/netdrive/\">NetDrive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/\">WinSFP</a> </li>\n<li><strong>Remote editing using vi/vim</strong> - Developing using vim on the development machine is a very powerful setup. This requires opening a terminal and connecting to the remote machine via SSH. Then navigating to your code base and running vim. You use vi’s powerful text editing features to edit files. A bit of tweaking and installing some vi/vim plugins would make vim work more like an IDE. The problem most have is the learning curve but once you get around the idea of coding on the terminal, you might end up loving it or not. :) Another minor issue is when you need to upload new files like images and PDFs. If you’re used to dragging and dropping your files into your IDE this might be off-putting. You will need a separate SFTP client to do upload these files. </li>\n</ul>\n<!--ad-->\n<p>  Here’s a link to my <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisbautista/vim-workflow/blob/master/.vimrc\">vimrc</a>.

Once you get the hang of it, you might NOT even need plugins. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Remote editing using a cloud editor</strong> - This has been quite popular lately. My favorite is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud9_IDE\">Cloud9 IDE</a>. Even <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/\">Amazon Web Services(AWS) uses it</a> for its cloud services. </p>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://github.com/c9/core\">Cloud9 IDE</a> project you can set up any code base and make it available via the browser. It is not as powerful as Eclipse ( or clones e.g. PHPStorm, Netbeans) but it keeps your code and tasks in the same machine — not yet at least. But it is significantly better than most options in this list as its very similar to how you would develop in a regular IDE. Most would have terminal emulation as well and support for plugins. The problem is you can’t really do this for all your projects. Since you will be exposing the editor via the browser you still run the risk having your code hacked easier than without it. Like any internal application, there are ways to secure it.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Install</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/c9/core.git c9sdk\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> c9sdk\nscripts/install-sdk.sh\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Start Cloud9 and expose /var/www/html</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">node</span> server.js <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-w</span> /var/www/html</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VSCode with remote development pack</strong> - To be precise, the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack\">Remote development pack</a> is only available through <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">VS Code Insiders edition</a> as of yet. No local code needed locally when using the remote development pack. The best benefit is all your beloved VSCode plugins can run on the code as if it’s local.\nAside from SSH, the pack also include support for container setups(Docker) and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). </p>\n<p>To install <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh\">Remote development pack: SSH</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Install an <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client\">OpenSSH compatible SSH client</a> if one is not already present.\nI recommend installing <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">Git Bash</a> for windows. </p>\n<p>Note: PuTTY is not supported on Windows since the ssh command must be in the path.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">Visual Studio Code Insiders</a>. </li>\n<li>Open <strong>Visual Studio Code Insiders</strong> then open modules</li>\n<li>Search for <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/\">Remote Development</a> extension pack, then hit Install.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From VS Code documentation</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>  [Optional] If your server requires multi-factor authentication, set “remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal”:“true” in settings.json\nand enable the <a href=\"http://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh%255fconfig%26arch=i386#ControlMaster\">ControlMaster</a> SSH feature. See here for details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>Since your code base needs to be accessed in the cloud, security is very important. Most of these setups use Secured SHell since its more secure than FTP and not to mention a lot of firewalls would have SSH open. There are also some features you might want to keep to secure SSH further. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never let login with root <code class=\"language-text\">(PermitRootLogin=no)</code> and create sudo-users</li>\n<li>Enable key authentication <code class=\"language-text\">(PubKeyAuthentication=yes)</code></li>\n<li>Limiting the service to a specific host and address instead of listening to all interfaces.\n<code class=\"language-text\">(ListenAddress=hostname:port)</code></li>\n<li>Create Private keys with passphrases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are other SSHD configuration options that can further secure your connection. Check some recommendations from <a href=\"https://www.ssh.com/ssh/\">ssh.com</a></p>\n<p>For Cloud editors like Cloud9 IDE; Enabling SSL(HTTPS), gating(strong password) and limiting access to known networks will keep your risk to a minimum. </p>\n<h2>Recommendation</h2>\n<p>I still prefer using vim for remote development but having an IDE setup like <strong>VSCode with Remote Development pack</strong> comes with great benefits which a developer like me finds quite appealing. Having to use a graphical UI for engaging my code base not to mention having some great plugins for language support is a major plus. But I digress, this is not an article to compare the benefits of IDEs in development. :) I’ll let you decide on that on your own. </p>\n<p>It really depends on what’s available for you and how comfortable you are in different environments. </p>\n<p>*Image attributed to <strong>Microsoft VS Code Documentation</strong>.*</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2019/remote-development-setups/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 19, 2019","title":"Remote Development Setup","featured_image":"/architecture-ssh.png","tags":["tutorial","IDE"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Hosting a project wiki or a personal blog on Github is very easy with github-pages and static site generators like Jekyll.

I have to research a way to reuse my timing snippets into proper Angular code.  To study, I built a simple angular app:<!--more--> </p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>How to use AngularJS to make a time-related app, in this case, a timer for logging elapsed time?</p>\n<h2>What I need</h2>\n<p>Before I started this little venture, I need to detail the parameters of the experiment.</p>\n<p>Firstly,  I need to layout my application into two sections. The top section will show a digital clock face and a button to toggle(start or stop) the clock. The bottom section will be a table showing start and end times, as well as the total duration. To know that the application is successful, start and end times should be logged. Using those values I can compute for the duration.</p>\n<p>We have two modes; an idle state,”stopped” and an active mode,”started”. We need to consider that when coding the helper functions.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we start with a basic AngularJS template. Please note I am assuming you have at least some experience working with HTML, Javascript, and AngularJS.</p>\n<p>I need two sections so I make two main DIVs.</p>\n<p>Next, in DIV 1,  we add another div to serve as the container for the timer digits and a button.</p>\n<p>Next in DIV #2, we format a table with a header and three columns; “Start”, “End” and “Duration(secs)” correspondingly.</p>\n<p>What we have now is not very pretty, we’re going to fix that in a bit. Create a CSS file, call it “app.css”. Let’s style everything as follows,</p>\n<p>Looking good! 🙂  Now to add the functionality we need. Let’s start with some data binding and a basic controller.</p>\n<h4>HTML</h4>\n<h3>Javascript</h3>\n<p>Awesome! For the button, we’re going to use that as a trigger to toggle between modes as well as an indicator to show the user what’s happening.</p>\n<p>Now, we can switch between modes, using the button data {{mode}} as a toggle flag. Now to the meat of the application, as a reference I’m going to use this basic clock code I use when I need digital clock displays.</p>\n<p>The hero of this application is AngularJS’s <a title=\"$timeout service\" href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout\" target=\"_blank\">$timeout service</a>. The $timeout service gives the user a wrapper for window.setTimeOut. So it still acts like setTimeOut but with the code organization and excellent exception handling that AngularJS provides. Our code should follow this format</p>\n<p>We build the clock functionality via a $timeout statement, but first let’s refactor our controller and add two functions to handle the Start and Stop modes.</p>\n<p>Now for the $timeout service,</p>\n<p>You can see that we used the timeout service to recursively call the <strong>StartTimer</strong> function. When you call <code class=\"language-text\">$timeout</code>, just as window.setTimeOut, you create a timing object that we then save to our variable ‘tmPromise’. We’ll get into more of that later just take a note of it. Since we’re really making a stopwatch and not a clock that tells the current time, let’s recode. We need the current time so we use <code class=\"language-text\">date.getTime()</code>. Adding two more variables timeStart and timeEnd. When we button is clicked, we save the time to <strong>timerStart</strong>. Every time the timeout completes and we call StartTimer, the value of <strong>$scope.timeEnd</strong> changes. We then subtract <strong>$scope.timeStart</strong> to get the current elapsed time in milliseconds. We add some normalization code and we end up with this,</p>\n<p>Now for the stopTimer function, issuing the cancel method will stop the $timeout service. Remember the variable we made earlier, ‘tmPromise’. We will use that as the parameter for our cancel call illustrated below. We then collect the start and end times and push that into the history array.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Yay, we just made an AngularJS timer widget. Adding a service to insert a line in our table we end up with this.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple implementation. One that did not need a unit test but if we wanted to, we can use a $timeout.flush() method.

First in my list was a workflow to streamline development. It’s been a while since I modified my workflow and so I thought it was time for a change.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Aside from the design and flow of the application, my immediate concern was where to host my apps once I’m done with the first milestone. I was researching around the interweb and a familiar link caught my eye.  Heroku was the 2nd link of my search. I investigated Heroku when I first made a Facebook application for Lowe Philippines.  I remember seeing a link to Heroku from Facebook’s “Create App” wizard. Back then I was more curious than impressed. Anyway, this time I was very curious but now I’m also very impressed with how Heroku made it easy to deploy an app. Heroku does not magically build a scaffold for you but it does guide you through steps in their “Getting started” page and heck it’s free.  </p>\n<p><strong>What you get for a free account?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One(1) Dyno</li>\n<li>10,000 rows of data (postgres)</li>\n<li>512 Mb RAM</li>\n<li>One(1) hour business-hour support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A dyno is a processing unit coined by Heroku. Heroku help says “A dyno is a lightweight container running a single user-specified command. You can think of it as a virtualized Unix container—it can run any command available in its default environment”. It’s a lot to take in but it simply means you have one worker processing requests and things for you to serve your website and other arbitrary functions like data requests.  One seems not a lot but with how fast this requests gets done you won’t even notice, unless of course your application gets some substantial traffic.  Aside from the dyno, you get to save 10000 rows of data to Postgres and a generous 512Mb RAM allocation.  If you think your application will need more resources, you can scale up by buying more dynos.  But for a hobby app or POC, a Heroku free account will serve you nicely.</p>\n<p><strong>How to start?</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku is very easy to setup.  You can go straight to the toolbelt and the dashboard or you can go to their Getting Started page, which I recommend if you’re starting to learn or new to deploying to Heroku.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/start\" title=\"start here to build your heroku app\">Getting Started</a> &#x3C;-  start here</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku supports a number of languages including PHP, NodeJS etc.  This time I was making a PHP application with some AngularJS for the frontend so I followed the PHP track. Anyway, I just did the steps and I got a functional workflow as a starting point.</p>\n<p>In summary the steps are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and Install Heroku Toolbelt for your OS.</li>\n<li>Login to Heroku</li>\n<li>Get keys</li>\n<li>Create App</li>\n<li>Deploy App with git push</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Is that it?</strong></p>\n<p>You followed the steps, and you got a lean file structure to start with. You have to ,of course, be familiar with Composer and Git to optimize your project, both of which are not covered by this post. Just google them, there are a lot of well written articles and tutorials out there. I especially like the ff:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md\">https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics\">https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics</a></p>\n<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>The cool thing about this is everything is accessible and manageable from one console. If you’re a little queasy at the idea of working with the console,  this might not be the best thing for you. An alternative is the Heroku dashboard – just create the app and  setup a more familiar way of deployment like github.  Just provide Heroku of a repo and Heroku will monitor and automatically deploy your app when a change is uploaded.</p>\n<p>Heroku is neat and well documented. There’s a bit of a learning curve  especially if you’re starting to learn to code or is a total console-phobe. Also, if you’re app has grown popular and pulling some substantial traffic, you need to increase the dynos or your app will shutdown and refuse to process requests. Which will catch a hefty bill. Nevertheless, it does get you started with some impressive workflow and and it’s free-ish. 🙂</p>\n<p><em>Some notes:</em></p>\n<p>First time you push a project (git push heroku master) and it’s empty, it would trigger a error similar to this</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">!     Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected</code></p>\n<p>It just means, Heroku does not know what your app is about and so it can’t build the application. Solution is just provide a common starter file like index.php or index.html. This will tell Heroku that you have a PHP or HTML project and build the necessary dependencies.  You can also fix this by providing a composer.json, setting up the dependencies you need.</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-318 size-full\" src=\"/assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-768x449.png\" alt=\"Deploy\" width=\"846\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"/assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM.png 846w, /assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-300x176.png 300w, /assets/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-28-at-1.35.13-PM-768x449.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px\" />","fields":{"slug":"/2014/quick-and-free-way-to-set-up-your-app-using-heroku/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 20, 2014","title":"Quick and Free Way to Set Up Your App using Heroku","featured_image":"/assets/2014/08/features-tools-3dc022115028973bfa824eb354f1d87c.png","tags":["website","devops"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"When I started blogging again last September, I was delighted to get a template with built-in message polling to twitter.

Great as it is – it’s not perfect. What the widget lacks is interactivity. One day, I started planning (with frameworks like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">Jquery</a> and <a href=\"http://mootools.net/\">Mootools</a> in mind), to make a custom widget that can access <a href=\"http://apiwiki.twitter.com/\">twitter API</a> with features like searching for a user’s tweets or scrolling through a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twitter101/learning\">Trending Topic</a> . Also thought adding some nice animation and CSS styles. Luckily, I don’t have to; the nice peeps from Twitter beat me to the punch and released a widget – packing almost all the things I wanted. I experimented with this along with some feed scripts from Google a days back (<a href=\"http://potatokorner.blogspot.com/2009/10/updates-on-pepeng.html#main\">Updates on Pepeng</a>).</p>\n<h4>What is a Twitter Search Widget!?</h4>\n<p>The widget’s concept is to supply the it with a search term (or phrase), like ‘potatokorner’ and it will periodically check twitter.com for tweets with the word potatokorner – but not just tweets by yours truly – every single tweet which it appears. Unlike a regular search the widget periodically pulls messages from the site(twitter) and displays it in a marquee.

Fortunately, Twitter.com provided quite a collection of filters to narrow down your search. You can limit tweets to a certain vicinity( near:{location}) or screen out certain words ( -{word}), you can even limit them to happy ones ( 🙂 ). See <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/operators\">Advance operators</a> to build your strings. I won’t touch this much, but I’ll explain what I’m going to use.</p>\n<p>For our example, I want to add a twitter search widget to find tweets with the word “party”, but I only want positive or happy tweets! , thus the smiley, ” 🙂 “. The smiley is a generic one, but twitter is smart enough to find all the variations (e.g. “:D”,”=)” etc. ). Now lets test it.</p>\n<div>\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtQSnAXbI/AAAAAAAADLc/OW3As3VfJpY/s1600-h/potatokorner-twitter-search-test.PNG\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StvtQSnAXbI/AAAAAAAADLc/OW3As3VfJpY/s320/potatokorner-twitter-search-test.PNG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Great!

Let’s go with Gmail. You log in to Gmail – find a comfortable page like the inbox or the login page. Normally for security purposes I’d go with the login page, but since I’m the only one using this workstation lets make it easy for me and pick the Inbox as our starting page.</p>\n<p>Now a popup should appear asking where you want to place your shortcut. It can be on the Desktop, the start menu, or a shortcut on the Quicklaunch bar. This is just a matter of preference. I prefer the Quicklaunch bar to maintain the minimalist feel of this system.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s1600-h/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StH9X1KKHVI/AAAAAAAADKE/vX_2bLjktWg/s400/potatokorner-build-workstation-using-chrome-gmail-step2.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"289\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Voila! you now have an email client on steroids.

Any Operating System has it in some form or another(Anyone said <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))\" target=\"_blank\">Lynx</a>(?). Companies battle it out for supremacy, sometimes even forcing their religion; <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729&pn=2\" target=\"_blank\">I mean browser, down our throats</a>. Whatever a browser is or where it came from, it paved the way for the information superhighway AKA The Internet. That is cause for celebration and dedicatory site, won’t you agree? </p>\n<p>WhatBrowser.org is kind of timely if you think <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729\" target=\"_blank\">Oct 13 will be birthday no. 15</a> of the commercial browser. Imagine software, a teener! No wonder some people still gets confused (LOL).</p>\n<h2>Visit the site</h2>\n<p>When you visit the site, you are presented a video. The video is a cute presentation of what a browser Is and what it is Not. It continues with what you can do with it(browser). Watch the video. It may amuse you and educate you a bit at the same time. Also opposite the video is the name of the browser you used to access the site, the user-agent. You can see that I use Chrome. I will admit that lacking plugins for Chrome was kind of a turn off at first, but with the release of the <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">dev channel</a> and it’s plugin support, I found myself doing more and more work with it, but thats a topic for another day. </p>\n<p>Your user-agent may not be what you expect it to be,since some browsers enable you to <a href=\"http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html\" target=\"_blank\">change user agents</a>. The site also has 3 more sections below the video, linking to other features/services. I especially like the “Under the hood” page. There you can subject your browser to some benchmarking tests. I’ll post a comprehensive post related to this tests later.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s1600-h/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s400/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\"></a><br>WhatBrowser.Org\n</div>\n<p>The site is a awesome idea.
