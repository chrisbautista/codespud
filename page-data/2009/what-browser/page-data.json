Ever met someone who keeps confusing a browser with a webpage? Are you still at hairs end trying to pick the best one? Don’t fret, Google comes to the rescue again. </p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Built by “some folks from Google”, WhatBrowser.org is a site dedicated to what we all would agree to be the most used application in any computer, “the Browser”. Any Operating System has it in some form or another(Anyone said <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))\" target=\"_blank\">Lynx</a>(?). Companies battle it out for supremacy, sometimes even forcing their religion; <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729&pn=2\" target=\"_blank\">I mean browser, down our throats</a>. Whatever a browser is or where it came from, it paved the way for the information superhighway AKA The Internet. That is cause for celebration and dedicatory site, won’t you agree? </p>\n<p>WhatBrowser.org is kind of timely if you think <a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729\" target=\"_blank\">Oct 13 will be birthday no. 15</a> of the commercial browser. Imagine software, a teener! No wonder some people still gets confused (LOL).</p>\n<h2>Visit the site</h2>\n<p>When you visit the site, you are presented a video. The video is a cute presentation of what a browser Is and what it is Not. It continues with what you can do with it(browser). Watch the video. It may amuse you and educate you a bit at the same time. Also opposite the video is the name of the browser you used to access the site, the user-agent. You can see that I use Chrome. I will admit that lacking plugins for Chrome was kind of a turn off at first, but with the release of the <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel\" target=\"_blank\">dev channel</a> and it’s plugin support, I found myself doing more and more work with it, but thats a topic for another day. </p>\n<p>Your user-agent may not be what you expect it to be,since some browsers enable you to <a href=\"http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html\" target=\"_blank\">change user agents</a>. The site also has 3 more sections below the video, linking to other features/services. I especially like the “Under the hood” page. There you can subject your browser to some benchmarking tests. I’ll post a comprehensive post related to this tests later.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s1600-h/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/StCj8W4Lr_I/AAAAAAAADJs/oMXt0rUh3tw/s400/potatokorner-whatbrowser.PNG\"></a><br>WhatBrowser.Org\n</div>\n<p>The site is a awesome idea. Maybe in the near future, the site will grow and provide even more tools to help us understand and make the most out of our “browsers”. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.whatbrowser.org/\">What Browser? – Home</a></strong></p>\n<h2>Read some more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://websearch.about.com/od/whatistheinternet/a/browser.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://websearch.about.com/od/whatistheinternet/a/browser.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://kb.iu.edu/data/aepv.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://kb.iu.edu/data/aepv.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/17/yeah-what-is-a-browser-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/17/yeah-what-is-a-browser-anyway/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://browsers.about.com/od/howbrowserswork/a/whatisabrowser.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://browsers.about.com/od/howbrowserswork/a/whatisabrowser.htm</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/2009/what-browser/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Browser?","date":"October 10, 2009","tags":["browser","website"],"featured_image":null,"featured_image_attribution":null,"contentType":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2009/what-browser/","tags":["browser","website"],"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/funny-video-animator-vs-animated/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Funny Video: Animator vs Animated","contentType":null,"tags":["fun","animation","video"],"draft":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009/all-you-need-is-a-browser/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"All You Need Is A Browser","contentType":null,"tags":["browser","webapps","tip"],"draft":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2139210123","63159454"]}
