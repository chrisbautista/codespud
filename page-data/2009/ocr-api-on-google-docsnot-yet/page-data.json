Q is not around to give him a nifty watch-slash-camera with OCR features. Good thing he also talks geek and plays with GoogleAPIs. He uploads the digital image into Google Docs and after a length of a blink, he gets a text version of the document. M receives the document, sends Bond a beautiful accountant to “help” him, found the location of the villain, saves the world – the end.</p>\n<p>summary: 007:The Gold Potato that Never Dies Tomorrow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a name=\"more\"></a><br>\n_Oh, I forgot he gets to trash another Aston Martin while saving the girl(not the accountant).<br>\n_<br>\nOCR is not integrated into Google Docs Home interface yet, but this API improvement is a step closer.
