I make resolutions every year - and every year - I fall short. But I am stubborn too. So this year, I have decided to be a better programmer and work on my journey in this blog. I am starting with my new year’s resolution as a front-end developer. <!--more--></p>\n<p>To keep me honest I have contracted my wife to check on my progress every month for each resolution. I made it a mission where I get a reward for accomplising my goal and punishment if I fail.  I got the idea from this list of <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/strict-commitment-apps-that-force-you-working/\">commitment apps</a>. My wife promised to make it really hurt financially if I fail. That should keep me on my toes.😁</p>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/\">Math’s programmers resolutions</a> here are my five new year resolutions. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#frameworks\">Learn three(3) new front-end frameworks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#accessibility\">Focus on web accessibility</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#blog\">Create one (1) blog post per week</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#stayhealthy\">Stay healthy</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"#workflow\">Streamline workflow</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"frameworks\">1. Learn three (3) new front-end frameworks </h2>\n<p>This year was a good year for frameworks. <a href=\"https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#frameworks\">More and more developers are using front-end frameworks</a>. I aim to learn at least three(3) new front-end frameworks. I have been working primarily with ReactJS. I can not say I am an expert. But I am proficient enough to earn a living. This year to start, I want the reach the same proficiency in Vue, Svelte, and NextJS. I have chosen these three because they are well documented and I found a great amount of community support. </p>\n<p>By the end of this year, I should have the following for each language;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal project on github</li>\n<li>Blog post on how I made the project</li>\n<li>Cheatsheet I can share on this blog </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">2. Focus on web accessibility </h2>\n<p>This year I have been interested with web accessibility. I thought I had been doing a great job of making my projects inclusive. I was dead wrong. This year I will work on projects that improve accessibility, champion accessibility in our company, and share my experiences with my peers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blog\">3. Create one (1) blog post per week</h2>\n<p>I started blogging to force myself to share the things that interest me. Sharing is my incentive to explore new things. I have been really lax this past few years. I used personal stuff as an excuse when really its my lack of discipline is the issue. This past few months I have been blogging, I realized I learn more when creating an article than I do at studying intentionally. Blogging forces me to research and dig deep into the topic than when I am just solving a specific problem. This year I will try to publish at least one(1) post a week. </p>\n<h2 id=\"stayhealthy\">4. Stay healthy</h2>\n<p>From Math’s list of programmer’s resolution, this one resonated with me a lot. For most who work as a developer keeping healthy is a hard battle. This year I want to do what I can to be healthy. Starting with the following habits;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less caffeine</li>\n<li>Go out for fresh air at least once a day</li>\n<li>Run twice a week</li>\n<li>Set aside some time to be offline once a day</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"workflow\">5. Streamline workflow</h2>\n<p>To accomplish the previous resolutions, I need to be more efficient. I have not explored automating some of my tasks and been working with the same toolset from three years ago. This year I will explore streamlining my workflow.  </p>\n<p>Tasks like; </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing a new machine for development;</li>\n<li>Cleaning up my IDE plugins;</li>\n<li>Using design software</li>\n<li>Uncluttering my workstation</li>\n<li>Exploring new tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will probably figure out more things to do later. I will keep you updated. </p>\n<p>So that’s it! I have listed my new year’s resolution as a programmer. What’s yours? </p>\n<p>Happy new year to all! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2022/programmers_resolution_2023/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"December 31, 2022","title":"Programmer's New Year Resolution","featured_image":"/blog/boliviainteligente-unsplash.jpg","tags":["web-development","personal","frontend"]}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"I’ve got some leeway pushing Khrunus off the ground.  I’ve always been successful using JavaScript’s timing functions but since Khrunus would primarily be built-in in AngularJS.

I have to research a way to reuse my timing snippets into proper Angular code.  To study, I built a simple angular app:<!--more--> </p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>How to use AngularJS to make a time-related app, in this case, a timer for logging elapsed time?</p>\n<h2>What I need</h2>\n<p>Before I started this little venture, I need to detail the parameters of the experiment.</p>\n<p>Firstly,  I need to layout my application into two sections. The top section will show a digital clock face and a button to toggle(start or stop) the clock. The bottom section will be a table showing start and end times, as well as the total duration. To know that the application is successful, start and end times should be logged. Using those values I can compute for the duration.</p>\n<p>We have two modes; an idle state,”stopped” and an active mode,”started”. We need to consider that when coding the helper functions.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we start with a basic AngularJS template. Please note I am assuming you have at least some experience working with HTML, Javascript, and AngularJS.</p>\n<p>I need two sections so I make two main DIVs.</p>\n<p>Next, in DIV 1,  we add another div to serve as the container for the timer digits and a button.</p>\n<p>Next in DIV #2, we format a table with a header and three columns; “Start”, “End” and “Duration(secs)” correspondingly.</p>\n<p>What we have now is not very pretty, we’re going to fix that in a bit. Create a CSS file, call it “app.css”. Let’s style everything as follows,</p>\n<p>Looking good! 🙂  Now to add the functionality we need. Let’s start with some data binding and a basic controller.</p>\n<h4>HTML</h4>\n<h3>Javascript</h3>\n<p>Awesome! For the button, we’re going to use that as a trigger to toggle between modes as well as an indicator to show the user what’s happening.</p>\n<p>Now, we can switch between modes, using the button data {{mode}} as a toggle flag. Now to the meat of the application, as a reference I’m going to use this basic clock code I use when I need digital clock displays.</p>\n<p>The hero of this application is AngularJS’s <a title=\"$timeout service\" href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$timeout\" target=\"_blank\">$timeout service</a>. The $timeout service gives the user a wrapper for window.setTimeOut. So it still acts like setTimeOut but with the code organization and excellent exception handling that AngularJS provides. Our code should follow this format</p>\n<p>We build the clock functionality via a $timeout statement, but first let’s refactor our controller and add two functions to handle the Start and Stop modes.</p>\n<p>Now for the $timeout service,</p>\n<p>You can see that we used the timeout service to recursively call the <strong>StartTimer</strong> function. When you call <code class=\"language-text\">$timeout</code>, just as window.setTimeOut, you create a timing object that we then save to our variable ‘tmPromise’. We’ll get into more of that later just take a note of it. Since we’re really making a stopwatch and not a clock that tells the current time, let’s recode. We need the current time so we use <code class=\"language-text\">date.getTime()</code>. Adding two more variables timeStart and timeEnd. When we button is clicked, we save the time to <strong>timerStart</strong>. Every time the timeout completes and we call StartTimer, the value of <strong>$scope.timeEnd</strong> changes. We then subtract <strong>$scope.timeStart</strong> to get the current elapsed time in milliseconds. We add some normalization code and we end up with this,</p>\n<p>Now for the stopTimer function, issuing the cancel method will stop the $timeout service. Remember the variable we made earlier, ‘tmPromise’. We will use that as the parameter for our cancel call illustrated below. We then collect the start and end times and push that into the history array.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Yay, we just made an AngularJS timer widget. Adding a service to insert a line in our table we end up with this.</p>\n<p>This is a very simple implementation. One that did not need a unit test but if we wanted to, we can use a $timeout.flush() method.
