Might be the reason for it’s sudden increase in popularity for such a short period. It doesn’t hurt either that it’s officially endorsed by twitter.com.</p>\n<p>The member’s site has a number of features but I’ll concentrate on URL shortening and tracking.</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/St_PiBvq24I/AAAAAAAADNc/zzDKghXJmQc/s1600-h/potatokorner-bit-ly.PNG\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/St_PiBvq24I/AAAAAAAADNc/zzDKghXJmQc/s320/potatokorner-bit-ly.PNG\" alt border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Above screenshot you see the URL entry tool in RED dashed borders. This is where you jam your uber long URL. Usually, URL shortening is more conveniently done via an API call via a tool in your client software. But if you’re just want your un-memorize-able URL to be easier to carry around or share then the web tool should suffice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">bit.ly, a simple url shortener</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bit.ly, A Simple URL Shortener","date":"October 17, 2009","featured_image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/bit-ly-a-simple-url-shortener/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/all-you-need-is-a-browser/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"All You Need Is A Browser","contentType":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/install-twitter-search-widget/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Install Twitter Search Widget","contentType":null}}}}}
