I make resolutions every year - and every year - I fall short. But I am stubborn too. So this year, I have decided to be a better programmer and work on my journey in this blog. I am starting with my new year‚Äôs resolution as a front-end developer. <!--more--></p>\n<p>To keep me honest I have contracted my wife to check on my progress every month for each resolution. I made it a mission where I get a reward for accomplising my goal and punishment if I fail.  I got the idea from this list of <a href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/strict-commitment-apps-that-force-you-working/\">commitment apps</a>. My wife promised to make it really hurt financially if I fail. That should keep me on my toes.üòÅ</p>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/\">Math‚Äôs programmers resolutions</a> here are my five new year resolutions. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#frameworks\">Learn three(3) new front-end frameworks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#accessibility\">Focus on web accessibility</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#blog\">Create one (1) blog post per week</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#stayhealthy\">Stay healthy</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"#workflow\">Streamline workflow</a> </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"frameworks\">1. Learn three (3) new front-end frameworks </h2>\n<p>This year was a good year for frameworks. <a href=\"https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#frameworks\">More and more developers are using front-end frameworks</a>. I aim to learn at least three(3) new front-end frameworks. I have been working primarily with ReactJS. I can not say I am an expert. But I am proficient enough to earn a living. This year to start, I want the reach the same proficiency in Vue, Svelte, and NextJS. I have chosen these three because they are well documented and I found a great amount of community support. </p>\n<p>By the end of this year, I should have the following for each language;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal project on github</li>\n<li>Blog post on how I made the project</li>\n<li>Cheatsheet I can share on this blog </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">2. Focus on web accessibility </h2>\n<p>This year I have been interested with web accessibility. I thought I had been doing a great job of making my projects inclusive. I was dead wrong. This year I will work on projects that improve accessibility, champion accessibility in our company, and share my experiences with my peers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blog\">3. Create one (1) blog post per week</h2>\n<p>I started blogging to force myself to share the things that interest me. Sharing is my incentive to explore new things. I have been really lax this past few years. I used personal stuff as an excuse when really its my lack of discipline is the issue. This past few months I have been blogging, I realized I learn more when creating an article than I do at studying intentionally. Blogging forces me to research and dig deep into the topic than when I am just solving a specific problem. This year I will try to publish at least one(1) post a week. </p>\n<h2 id=\"stayhealthy\">4. Stay healthy</h2>\n<p>From Math‚Äôs list of programmer‚Äôs resolution, this one resonated with me a lot. For most who work as a developer keeping healthy is a hard battle. This year I want to do what I can to be healthy. Starting with the following habits;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less caffeine</li>\n<li>Go out for fresh air at least once a day</li>\n<li>Run twice a week</li>\n<li>Set aside some time to be offline once a day</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"workflow\">5. Streamline workflow</h2>\n<p>To accomplish the previous resolutions, I need to be more efficient. I have not explored automating some of my tasks and been working with the same toolset from three years ago. This year I will explore streamlining my workflow.  </p>\n<p>Tasks like; </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing a new machine for development;</li>\n<li>Cleaning up my IDE plugins;</li>\n<li>Using design software</li>\n<li>Uncluttering my workstation</li>\n<li>Exploring new tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will probably figure out more things to do later. I will keep you updated. </p>\n<p>So that‚Äôs it! I have listed my new year‚Äôs resolution as a programmer. What‚Äôs yours? </p>\n<p>Happy new year to all! üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2022/programmers_resolution_2023/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programmer's New Year Resolution","date":"December 31, 2022","tags":["web-development","personal","frontend"],"featured_image":"/blog/boliviainteligente-unsplash.jpg","featured_image_attribution":"photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@boliviainteligente\">BoliviaInteligente</a>","contentType":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022/programmers_resolution_2023/","tags":["web-development","personal","frontend"],"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/custom_button-a_study_on_react_accessibility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React Custom button: a study on accessibility","contentType":null,"tags":["web-development","reactjs","accessibility"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2139210123","63159454"]}
