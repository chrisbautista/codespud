Each of which is inspired by different submissions. So no one submission can claim the idea, just part of the whole. Its a wonder how some minds are alike. üôÇ Even greater wonder that they choose to do good with those creative brains.<br>\n<a name=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>What now?!</strong></p>\n<p>Now they are asking for people to vote. To pick the ideas they believe can make the difference. Out of 16 they need 5 ideas to turn into funded projects. The call to vote started September 24, 2009 and will end October 8, 2009.
