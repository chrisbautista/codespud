I have been managing linux servers since 2002, back then I was assigned to develop web applications in Redhat Linux Servers. I was hesitant at first (fearful to say the least), I can still remember my heart racing whenever something broke. My knowledge of the OS is non-existent. A friend of mine taught me some commands like <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">[ls]</span> and <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">[tail]</span>, that got me a week or two. But soon tasks had grown complex overtime. I needed to learn so I started a blog (my first one), so I can phase my study of the <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">[Penguin]</span>, it helped me a lot. Unfortunately, after sometime my blog host went bankrupt. I lost interest so I discontinued, and life went on as they say. </p>\n<p>Blogging gave me the motivation to study further than I would. So finally, after 3 years, Iâ€™m starting this once again as a refresher, an online linux course for me and those who would happen to need it. ðŸ™‚ Cheers!</p>\n<p>Image fromÂ <a href=\"http://travelhouseuk.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://travelhouseuk.wordpress.com/</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2006/linux-series-introduction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux: Series Introduction","date":"May 28, 2006","tags":null,"featured_image":null,"featured_image_attribution":null,"contentType":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2006/linux-series-introduction/","tags":null,"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/lorem-ipsum-dummy-text-for-font-testing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lorem Ipsum â€“ Dummy text for Font Testing","contentType":null,"tags":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/linux-commands-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Commands #1","contentType":null,"tags":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2139210123","63159454"]}
