It took another year(2009) and 3000 Google employees to sort them through. The ideas need to cover one of the following categories</p>\n<p>Categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community:</strong> How can we help connect people, build communities and protect unique cultures?</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> How can we help people better provide for themselves and their families?</li>\n<li><strong>Energy:</strong> How can we help move the world toward safe, clean, inexpensive energy?</li>\n<li><strong>Environment:</strong> How can we help promote a cleaner and more sustainable global ecosystem?</li>\n<li><strong>Health:</strong> How can we help individuals lead longer, healthier lives?</li>\n<li><strong>Education:</strong> How can we help more people get more access to better education?</li>\n<li><strong>Shelter:</strong> How can we help ensure that everyone has a safe place to live?</li>\n<li><strong>Everything else:</strong> Sometimes the best ideas donâ€™t fit into any category at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of the huge collection of ideas, they have narrowed them down to 16. Each of which is inspired by different submissions. So no one submission can claim the idea, just part of the whole. Its a wonder how some minds are alike. ðŸ™‚ Even greater wonder that they choose to do good with those creative brains.<br>\n<a name=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>What now?!</strong></p>\n<p>Now they are asking for people to vote. To pick the ideas they believe can make the difference. Out of 16 they need 5 ideas to turn into funded projects. The call to vote started September 24, 2009 and will end October 8, 2009. Watch this video:</p>\n<div>\n</div>\n<p>So I invite you guys to go on <a href=\"//www.project10tothe100.com/vote.html\" target=\"_blank\">Project 10^100â€™s voting page</a>. Read all the ideas, and look into yourself what you think will help this hurting world of ours. Then pick the best one. After that invite others( friends,family, co-workers etc.) to do the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Itâ€™s great that large companies like Google still have that sense of civic responsibility to better this world. I hope this generation can nurture what Google started and the projects that will win this opportunity. God bless us all!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project 10^100: The Voting Begins","date":"September 25, 2009","featured_image":null,"featured_image_attribution":null,"contentType":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project-10100-the-voting-begins/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-export-command-to-help-linux-find-your-scripts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Use Export Command To Help Linux Find Your Scripts","contentType":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates-on-ondoy-places-to-donate-efforts-by-bloggers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updates on Ondoy: Places to donate â€“ Efforts by bloggers","contentType":null}}}}}
