But soon you got tired of typing the whole path or changing folders every time you need the app. You could simplify your life by making a symbolic link(shortcut) or a wrapper script and place it on a more convenient path like /bin or /usr/bin. But you realize that would be defeating your original intent. what do you do? <!--more--></p>\n<p><a name='more'></a><br>\nSimple. Do what experts do. Use “export” to modify the PATH environment variable.</p>\n<div>\n  > help export </p> \n  \n  <p>\n    export: export [-nf] [name[=value] &#8230;] or export -p <br />NAMEs are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the -f option is given, the NAMEs refer to functions. If no NAMEs are given, or if `-p&#8217; is given, a list of all names that are exported in this shell is printed. An argument of `-n&#8217; says to remove the export property from subsequent NAMEs. An argument of `&#8211;&#8216; disables further option processing.</div> \n    \n    <p>\n      To get an idea, try this command on the console:\n    </p>\n    \n    <div>\n      > echo $PATH</p> \n      \n      <p>\n        /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin</div> \n        \n        <p>\n        </p>\n        \n        <p>\n          The above value is a typical &#8220;root&#8221; PATH for a fresh text-only CentOS installation &#8211; so don&#8217;t fret if you got something different.
