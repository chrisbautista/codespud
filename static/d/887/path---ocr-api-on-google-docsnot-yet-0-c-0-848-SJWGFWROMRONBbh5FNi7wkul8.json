To put it simpy, sending an image(with readable text) to a DLDA application, when OCR is enabled into the request, will equip the API to read the image and generate a properly editable document.<!--more--></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Applied Fiction</p>\n<p>Agent 007 photographed a top secret document he needs to deliver to M in <em>CSV</em> format (LOL). Q is not around to give him a nifty watch-slash-camera with OCR features. Good thing he also talks geek and plays with GoogleAPIs. He uploads the digital image into Google Docs and after a length of a blink, he gets a text version of the document. M receives the document, sends Bond a beautiful accountant to “help” him, found the location of the villain, saves the world – the end.</p>\n<p>summary: 007:The Gold Potato that Never Dies Tomorrow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a name=\"more\"></a><br>\n_Oh, I forgot he gets to trash another Aston Martin while saving the girl(not the accountant).<br>\n_<br>\nOCR is not integrated into Google Docs Home interface yet, but this API improvement is a step closer.

The quality of the extracted text isn’t perfect yet, but we’re busy improving it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Miss or not, this is all very exciting, especially for Google Doc users like myself.</p>\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2009/09/import-scans-or-go-multilingual.html\">http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2009/09/import-scans-or-go-multilingual.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"OCR API on Google Docs(not yet)","date":"September 30, 2009","featured_image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/ocr-api-on-google-docsnot-yet/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/updated-list-of-verified-relief-centers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updated list of Verified Relief Centers"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/updates-on-pepeng/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Updates on Pepeng"}}}}
