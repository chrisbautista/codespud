I was so ridden with guilt, halfway thru Shaw MRT I thought of going back. Even with the phony indifference, I was worried of how you would feel.<span></span></span></p> \n    \n    <p>\n      <span style=\"font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Arial\">You can be so difficult sometimes and yet I can&#x2019;t spend the day without you. You&#x2019;ve struck a nerve a couple of times but I&#x2019;ll ignore it just to be with you a little longer.

I will never be lost as long as you&#x2019;re beside me. You are, clich&#xE9;s aside, my true north. <o:p></o:p></span>\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n      <span style=\"font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Arial\">I love you Baby! I will always will.
