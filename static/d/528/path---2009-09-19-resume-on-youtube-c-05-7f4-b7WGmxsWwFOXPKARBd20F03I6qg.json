(Cheers! claps! Bring in the beer! LOL). &nbsp;Gone will be the days where you had to restart a video just to continue where you left of. Now you dont need to restart a whole video or pause till the video fully loads then skip every so and so, just to pick up where you last watched.\n</div>\n<p><a name='more'></a></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  Note the feature will only work for resumes past the 3 minute mark &#8211; meaning any resumes less than mentioned duration are ignored &#8211; so you need to run the video from the start again. A perfectly logical limitation.&nbsp;</p> \n  \n  <p>\n    This addition is a big step forward for online media players &#8211; hopefully other video sites will follow suit. ðŸ™‚ &nbsp;For more info go <a href=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/09/youtube-resume.html\">here</a>\n  </p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Resume on Youtube!","date":"September 19, 2009","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-09-19-resume-on-youtube/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-09-19-google-got-recaptcha/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google got reCAPTCHA"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-09-20-xoxo-creativity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"XOXO Creativity"}}}}
