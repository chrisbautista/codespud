I have a lot of them. But nothing gets me back to those carefree days (more) than this poem :). </p>\n<p>When I read this, I remembered things. The aroma of cafeteria soup ,ready for recess time, squeezing through the windows while I raise my hand to make like a tree. I see a glimpse of the quadrangle, how it excites me to play again later with my friends, when I opened my mouth and shouted out the title. I hear the laughter of my classmates while I stumbled on the first stanza. Feel still the sweat forming on my forehead when I forgot the next one. And I still feel accomplishment when I finally did remember and finished reciting with claps all around. </p>\n<p>I love this poem. Not because its the best written or its the first I recited. I love it because it’s one of those things that paints back pictures of good times, sometimes more clearly than what happened 5 minutes ago. I’m growing old I guess. Nostalgia becomes staple like hot coffee. Anyway, here’s the poem – Enjoy!</p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SrIUXRKw6UI/AAAAAAAACfE/JzxwSxqN7Cg/s1600-h/oak1287kwjdhj.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SrIUXRKw6UI/AAAAAAAACfE/JzxwSxqN7Cg/s320/oak1287kwjdhj.jpg\"></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n  Maybe someday I can teach this to my children.\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>P.S.
