I&#8217;m not very fond of traffic enforcers so I rather not give them an excuse. He agreed. &nbsp;We divided the team into two groups each group will ride a different vehicle. I had Trish, Cristy and Kuya Rommel. &nbsp;Jhe had Cha, Nelsie and Ding. As anyone who knows me knows, I&#8217;m not very good with directions (Karen is better at this) so Kuya Rommel served as the navigator. &nbsp;My group left first to beat the 7AM ban. Via an sms echange between Trish and Jhe, we agreed to meet up at the Shell gas station along the highway to clear some things and &nbsp;get my car filled up. We arrived a little over 7:20AM &nbsp;Jhe&#8217;s team arriving just a couple minutes after. Then we&#8217;re on with the convoy. &nbsp;The rest of the trip was uneventful except of the occasional &#8211; &#8220;Ayun Kalbo!&#8221; (&#8216;Look a bald man!&#8217;) from Kuya Rommel &nbsp;followed by hardy laughter from my backseat passengers. .\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SpN_fHgsF9I/AAAAAAAACYY/660hiXOIMwE/s1600/IMG_2263.JPG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: justify;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SpN_fHgsF9I/AAAAAAAACYY/660hiXOIMwE/s320/IMG_2263.JPG\"></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <img class=\"separator\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SpN_gMwxt8I/AAAAAAAACYg/HbgZ5jUwy-M/s320/IMG_2265.JPG\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: justify;\">&#xA0;<img class=\"separator\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_BBS5bkzuLXM/SpN_WKMNWJI/AAAAAAAACW8/DK6js4SbiRQ/s320/IMG_2235.JPG\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: justify;\"><p></p> \n  \n  <p>\n    &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0; The place is Summit Ridge Hotel, just in front of the famous Josephine&#x2019;s Restaurant. It&#x2019;s a property owned and managed by Robinsons Land Corporation. The hotel sports 2 Training rooms named Oak and Birch tree(reminds me of a German Moreno for some reason. LOL) &#x2013; 90 and 40 capacity rooms respectively, a Ballroom able to house 400-500 people, for semi large groups &#x2013; three(3) function rooms spacious enough for 30 people, an indoor and al fresco restaurant, spacious basement parking, a well equipped gym. There are other offerings but I was not able to see them so I leave that for you to discover. Their promise; world &#x2013; class conference facilities while enjoying the comforts of a luxury hotel.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    We arrived 10AM &#x2013; it was really sunny. We parked in front of the hotel and went in to check-in at the front desk. After a few minutes , Jhe and Cha returns with 3 key cards. One for the married couple, one key went to the &#x201C;matakaw&#x201D; girls and card key 3 to us the Macho guys of GSPH. &#x1F600;\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    After I parked Badong(my car&#x2019;s pet name) at the basement level 1, I went up to see our room. I arrived with Mel and Ding still working out how to use the card key. I tried but failed as well. Good thing, housekeeping arrived and graciously showed us how. &#x201C;Wala sa bundok kc!&#x201D;, I muttered.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    </p></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Having Fun ‚Äì Bonding with my GSPH family (Part 1)","date":"Invalid date","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-09-11-/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-09-24-/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trailer: Michael Jackson ‚ÄúThis is It‚Äù Movie"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-01-01-/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Time for New Year Lists"}}}}
