I thought it was a hoax, the source was a practical joker of sorts and you do hear a lot of this on the net. I remember a while back, rumors spread that Robert Pattinson (the guy who plays Edward Cullen for the Twilight movie) died of some freak accident, that turned out to be a hoax. But when a lot of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tweep\" target=\"_blank\">tweeps</a> are sending their condolences, the truth felt like icy cold water over my head. Controversies aside, Michael Jackson is &#8211; was a great man. &nbsp; His music touched more hearts than anyone before him, and still does. You can have a billion R&B singers and gaZillion rock stars out there but you can only have one King of Pop&nbsp; More than his music, we will miss the man behind it. He truly won his immortality in this world and the next. &nbsp;&nbsp;>\n</div>\n<p>09/24/2009<br>\nUpdates: See the ” This is It ” Michael Jackson movie trailer <a href=\"http://www.potatokorner.co.cc/2009/09/trailer-michael-jackson-this-is-it.html#main\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Michael Jackson Dies","date":"Invalid date","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-06-26-/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-08-29-/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Site Map"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-01-22-/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tree Poem"}}}}
