**Self** is an award winning IOS app by AWARE foundation of Singapore.

> <span style="color: #898989;">Most women do not complain about domestic violence (verbal and physical) because they have no evidence to prove it. This app, when activated, monitors for a spike in the ambient sound decibel level (for example shouting), and automatically starts recording, saving an audio file in a secret folder. The victim can later use this recording as proof of abuse. The app also has an optional facility of automatically sending an SOS, via SMS, to a nominated person when the sound level rises above a certain point.</span>
