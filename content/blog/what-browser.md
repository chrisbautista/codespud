Ever wondered what a browser truly is? Or know someone you&#8217;ve been trying to educate for a long time to use one? Ever met someone who keeps confusing a browser with a webpage? Are you still at hairs end trying to pick the best one? Don&#8217;t fret, Google comes to the rescue again.

Built by &#8220;some folks from Google&#8221;, WhatBrowser.org is a site dedicated to what we all would agree to be the most used application in any computer, &#8220;the Browser&#8221;. Any Operating System has it in some form or another(Anyone said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser))" target="_blank">Lynx</a>(?). Companies battle it out for supremacy, sometimes even forcing their religion; <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729&pn=2" target="_blank">I mean browser, down our throats</a>. Whatever a browser is or where it came from, it paved the way for the information superhighway AKA The Internet. That is cause for celebration and dedicatory site, won&#8217;t you agree? 

WhatBrowser.org is kind of timely if you think <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=3203729" target="_blank">Oct 13 will be birthday no. 15</a> of the commercial browser. Imagine software, a teener! No wonder some people still gets confused (LOL).

## Visit the site

When you visit the site, you are presented a video. The video is a cute presentation of what a browser Is and what it is Not. It continues with what you can do with it(browser). Watch the video. It may amuse you and educate you a bit at the same time. Also opposite the video is the name of the browser you used to access the site, the user-agent. You can see that I use Chrome. I will admit that lacking plugins for Chrome was kind of a turn off at first, but with the release of the <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel" target="_blank">dev channel</a> and it&#8217;s plugin support, I found myself doing more and more work with it, but thats a topic for another day. 

Your user-agent may not be what you expect it to be,since some browsers enable you to <a href="http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html" target="_blank">change user agents</a>. The site also has 3 more sections below the video, linking to other features/services. I especially like the &#8220;Under the hood&#8221; page. There you can subject your browser to some benchmarking tests. I&#8217;ll post a comprehensive post related to this tests later.

The site is a awesome idea. Maybe in the near future, the site will grow and provide even more tools to help us understand and make the most out of our &#8220;browsers&#8221;.
