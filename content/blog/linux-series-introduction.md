Hi! I have been managing linux servers since 2002, back then I was assigned to develop web applications in Redhat Linux Servers. I was hesitant at first (fearful to say the least), I can still remember my heart racing whenever something broke. My knowledge of the OS is non-existent. A friend of mine taught me some commands like <span style="font-weight: bold;">[ls]</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">[tail]</span>, that got me a week or two. But soon tasks had grown complex overtime. I needed to learn so I started a blog (my first one), so I can phase my study of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Penguin]</span>, it helped me a lot. Unfortunately, after sometime my blog host went bankrupt. I lost interest so I discontinued, and life went on as they say. 

Blogging gave me the motivation to study further than I would. So finally, after 3 years, I&#8217;m starting this once again as a refresher, an online linux course for me and those who would happen to need it. ðŸ™‚ Cheers!
