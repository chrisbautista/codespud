Do you know how to send an SOS in morse code? Do you know your birthstone? Or the winners of the Oscars since 1927 ? MIStupid.com has an assortment of trivia and topics not known by the most of us. As a bonus they have categories with games and puzzles you can play with when you catch a bit of an information overload.

No matter how trivial or uninteresting the fact is **<span style="font-weight: bold;">MIStupid.com</span>** will surely have it, otherwise go back to **<span style="font-weight: bold;">Google</span>** (hehehe). Well okay itâ€™s not Encarta but its free and **<span style="color: green;"><span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">GREEN</span></span>** ðŸ™‚

Enjoy!
