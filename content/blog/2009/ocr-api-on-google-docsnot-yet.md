<a href="http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2009/09/import-scans-or-go-multilingual.html" target="_blank">Google API blog</a> announced today, new features for their <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/documents/overview.html" target="_blank&quot;&quot;">Documents List &#8211; Data APIs (DLDA)</a> &#8211; one of which is Optical Character Recognition(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" target="_blank">OCR</a>). To put it simpy, sending an image(with readable text) to a DLDA application, when OCR is enabled into the request, will equip the API to read the image and generate a properly editable document.<!--more-->

Good thing he also talks geek and plays with GoogleAPIs. He uploads the digital image into Google Docs and after a length of a blink, he gets a text version of the document. M receives the document, sends Bond a beautiful accountant to &#8220;help&#8221; him, found the location of the villain, saves the world &#8211; the end.

_Oh, I forgot he gets to trash another Aston Martin while saving the girl(not the accountant).

OCR is not integrated into Google Docs Home interface yet, but this API improvement is a step closer. Heres, a mockup of how I believe this feature would integrate into Google Docs&#8217;s upload function.

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-468" src="/assets/2009/09/ocr-googlemockup-300x212.png" alt="ocr-googlemockup" width="300" height="212" srcset="/assets/2009/09/ocr-googlemockup-300x212.png 300w, /assets/2009/09/ocr-googlemockup.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
</div>

The feature is still in its early stages, shown by errors and misses in documents generated by the live demo. The developers did say to use high quality images.

> OCR will only work well on high-resolution images. The quality of the extracted text isn&#8217;t perfect yet, but we&#8217;re busy improving it!

Miss or not, this is all very exciting, especially for Google Doc users like myself.
