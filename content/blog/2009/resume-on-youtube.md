  Streaming Video giant, Youtube, recently announced a Resume feature along with other improvements for their groundbreaking service. (Cheers! claps! Bring in the beer! LOL). <!--more-->Gone will be the days where you had to restart a video just to continue where you left of. Now you dont need to restart a whole video or pause till the video fully loads then skip every so and so, just to pick up where you last watched.


Note the feature will only work for resumes past the 3 minute mark &#8211; meaning any resumes less than mentioned duration are ignored &#8211; so you need to run the video from the start again. A perfectly logical limitation.&nbsp;
  
This addition is a big step forward for online media players &#8211; hopefully other video sites will follow suit. ðŸ™‚ &nbsp;For more info go <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/09/youtube-resume.html">here</a>
