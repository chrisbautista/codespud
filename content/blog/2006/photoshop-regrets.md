> Hi! Here&#8217;s my first article for Web design hope you enjoy it.

I am still a frustrated computer graphics artist, I dabbled a little in PS when I was still doing web design. But more and more  
I was stirred to doing more programming so that part of  
my &#8216;education&#8217; was stunted for a while. But when I get some free time I try to learn as much as I can. Mostly, for hobby but I&#8217;ve submitted some of them for work.

Enough of me, I scoured for resource sites to teach me  
do neat effects in Photoshop. I am listing a partial listing below so you can check  
them for yourself.
